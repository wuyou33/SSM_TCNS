The stability result is obtained in the more general context of differential inclusions. Concerning stabilizability, we focus on systemsaffine with respect to the input: we give some sufficient conditions for a system to be stabilized by means of a feedback law of the Jurdjevic-Quinn type.

This result is achieved with the intermediate result that asymptotic stability of a compact set for a hybrid system is generically robust to small, state-dependent perturbations. As a special case, we state a converse Lyapunov theorem for systems with logic variables and use this result to establish input-to-state stabilization using hybrid feedback control. The converse Lyapunov theorems are also used to establish semiglobal practical robustness to slowly varying, weakly jumping parameters, to temporal regularization, to the insertion of jumps according to an ldquoaverage dwell-timerdquo rule, and to the insertion of flow according to a ldquoreverse average dwell-timerdquo rule.},

This result unifies and generalizes previous results for differential and difference inclusions with outer semicontinuous and locally bounded right-hand sides. Furthermore, we give a description of forward completeness of a hybrid system in terms of a smooth Lyapunov-like function.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies the notion of Strong iISS, which imposes both integral input-to-state stability (iISS) and input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to small inputs. This combination characterizes the robustness property, exhibited by many practical systems, that the state remains bounded as long as the magnitude of exogenous inputs is reasonably small but may diverge for stronger disturbances. We provide three Lyapunov-type sufficient conditions for Strong iISS. One is based on iISS Lyapunov functions admitting a radially non- vanishing (class K) dissipation rate. However we show that it is not a necessary condition for Strong iISS. Two less conservative conditions are then provided, which are used to demonstrate that asymptotically stable bilinear systems are Strongly iISS. Finally, we discuss cascade and feedback interconnections of Strong iISS systems.},
  Annote                   = {This paper introduces a new concept of stability, called strong ISS, by merging two concepts that already exists: iISS and ISS. The main results consists in a Lyapunov sufficient condition for the strong iISS stability.

ISS stability concept has been relaxed in two main philosophies: Local ISS (LISS) and integral ISS. Although LISS is a weaker notion of stability in comparison do strong iISS, it does not ensure GAS of the system, in the absence of inputs. Concerning iISS, it provides robustness with respect to a class of inputs with finite energy but it does not for non-vanishing inputs. Furthermore, iISS may not provide a bound for solutions, in the case of vanishing inputs.

The definition of Strong iISS combines both properties: given that the input is small enough, the a solution of the system has an asymptotical bound satisfying the ISS inequality. On the other hand, if the input is larger than a given threshold, then a solution of the system has an asymptotical bound satisfying the iISS inequalitiy.

Results:

Theorems 1 and 2 provides a sufficient condition in terms of the existence of a Strong iISS-Lyapunov function. At this point, it is worth to note that the Strong iISS concept is not yet characterized by the existence of a Strong iISS-Lyapunov function.

Theorem 3 relates the Strong iISS concept to forward completness of a system. Theorem 4 states that the interconnection of Strong iISS systems is yet a Strong iISS system.},

The main goal of this paper is to give parallel and far more general results in the setting of hybrid dynamical systems. "

In the paper, only approximations around the origin are considered. The author introduces the definition of homogeneous approximation and dilatation of hybrid inclusions. To do so, they consider not only the homogeneous approximation of the flow and jump maps but also the "approximation" of the jump and flow sets by using tanget cones.

The authors also show that if the homogeneous approximation around the origin is robustly stable, then the original system is also robustly stable.},

Furthermore, extended Kalman{\^a}â‚¬ï¿½Yakubovich{\^a}â‚¬ï¿½Popov conditions in terms of the impulsive system dynamics characterizing dissipativeness via system storage functions are derived. Finally, the framework is specialized to passive and non-expansive impulsive systems to provide a generalization of the classical notions of passivity and non-expansivity for non-linear impulsive systems. These results are used in the second part of this paper to develop extensions of the small gain and positivity theorems for feedback impulsive systems as well as to develop optimal hybrid feedback controllers. },

It is shown that the hybrid cost functional can be evaluated in closed-form as long as the cost functional considered is related in a specific way to an underlying Lyapunov function that guarantees asymptotic stability of the non-linear closed-loop impulsive system.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we develop dissipativity notions for dynamical systems with discontinuous vector fields. Specifically, we consider dynamical systems with Lebesgue measurable and locally essentially bounded vector fields characterized by differential inclusions involving Filippov set-valued maps specifying a set of directions for the system velocity and admitting Filippov solutions with absolutely continuous curves. In particular, we introduce a generalized definition of dissipativity for discontinuous dynamical systems in terms of set-valued supply rate maps and set-valued storage maps consisting of locally Lebesgue integrable supply rates and Lipschitz continuous storage functions, respectively. In addition, we introduce the notion of a set-valued available storage map and a set-valued required supply map, and show that if these maps have closed convex images they specialize to single-valued maps corresponding to the smallest available storage and the largest required supply of the differential inclusion, respectively. Furthermore, we show that all system storage functions are bounded from above by the largest required supply and bounded from below by the smallest available storage, and hence, a dissipative differential inclusion can deliver to its surroundings only a fraction of its generalized stored energy and can store only a fraction of the generalized work done to it.},

The authors generalize the dissipative inequality for discontinuous functions (in particular, Filippov functions).

The main contribution, in my opinion are the lower and upper bound obtained by the authors:

" The set of all possible system storage functions is convex and every system storage function is bounded from below by the available system storage and bounded from above by the required energy supply. "

There are also conditions to switched systems. More precisely, conditions to conclude if switched systems wether dissipative or not.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of establishing stability of nonlinear interconnected systems. This paper introduces a mathematical formulation of the state-dependent scaling problems whose solutions directly provide Lyapunov functions proving stability properties of interconnected dissipative systems in a unified manner. Stability criteria are interpreted as sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the state-dependent scaling problems. Computing solutions to the problems is straightforward for systems covered by classical stability criteria. It, however, could be too difficult for systems with strong nonlinearity. The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness beyond formal applicability by focusing on interconnected integral input-to-state stable (iISS) systems and input-to-state stable (ISS) systems. This paper derives small-gain-type theorems for interconnected systems involving iISS systems from the state-dependent scaling formulation. This paper provides solutions and Lyapunov functions explicitly. The new framework seamlessly generalizes the ISS small-gain theorem and classical stability criteria such as the Lp small-gain theorem, the passivity theorems, the circle, and Popov criteria. State-dependence of the scaling is crucial for effective treatment of essential nonlinearities, while constants are sufficient for classical nonlinearities},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with conditions for the stability of interconnected nonlinear systems consisting of integral input-to-state stable (iISS) systems with external inputs. The treatment of iISS and input-to-state stable (ISS) systems is unified. Both necessary conditions and sufficient conditions are investigated using a Lyapunov formulation. In the presence of model uncertainty, this paper proves that, for the stability of the interconnected system, at least one subsystem is necessarily ISS which is a stronger stability property in the set of iISS. The necessity of a small-gain-type property is also demonstrated. This paper proposes a common form of smooth Lyapunov functions which can establish the iISS and the ISS of the interconnection comprising iISS and ISS subsystems whenever the small-gain-type condition is satisfied. The result covers situations more general than the earlier study and removes technical conditions assumed in the previous literature. Global asymptotic stability is discussed as a special case.},

The system under consideration is affine in the controls. In this case, the main difference w.r.t. the works of Malkin (1951) and Massera (1956) is that in their work, it was consdiered an actuator error in the system. In this work, this "disturbance" is considered as function that multiplies the input variable "u".

The author considers the nilpotent approximation (generated by taking Lie brackts of the vector fields) of affine systems. Such an approximation system have some symmetries (e.g. homogeneity with respect to a family of dilations)

The aim of the paper in to design feedback laws that preserve those symmetries for the closed loop system. These feedback laws are called homogeneous feedback laws. Moreover, such feedback laws asymtptocally stabilize the approximating system and locally asymptotically stabilizes the original system. The critical steps for the design of these controls are the construction (or selection) of a submanifold that can made invariant. 

Another interesting part of the work concerns the necessary conditions that the vector fields must satisfy for the existence of homogeneous feedback laws.

Section 3 presents an interesting point of view of homogenenous approximation. The authors starting by consider an automonous system $\dx = F(x)$. Here, for the first time, the state of the approximating system is restricted to a Cone formed by a dilation family and the points that belong to a omega-limit set. The results is presented in Theorem 3.1: the origin is asymptotically stable for $\dx=F(x)$ iff it is asymptotically stable for $\dx=F_0$ (,where F_0 is F restricted to the Cone)

The main results of the paper are the definition of this generalization, a definition of wISS stability concept and the characterization of the wISS in termos of the existence of a wISS-Lyapunov function. 

The main definitio, called Multiple-Measure Input Stable (MMIS) is an asymptotical bound on the solution norm (see (2)) that takes into account the measure of the solution, the measure of the initial condition and a measure no the max norm in the solution.

In the table I, by choosing different functions for the bounds, the authors show how this definition is a particular case of the each different ISS concept (ISS, IOS, OSS, IOSS etc).

Althought this defnition is presented, the authors were not able to derive a MMIS-Lyapunov function.

However, they did it for a particular case of MMIS. Firstly, they define this particular case by calling it wISS and define also what is a wISS-Lyapunov function (see Definition 4). Then, in Proposition 1, the authors charaterize the this stability concept by proving that a system being wISS is equivalent to the existence of a wISS-Lyapunov function for it.

Some comentaries are made about Stability with respect to 2 measures (developped by Teel and Praly) as well as IOS-Lyapunov functions.},

  Abstract                 = {We study stability of hybrid systems described as feedback interconnections of smaller subsystems, within a Lyapunov-based ISS small-gain analysis framework. We focus on constructing a weak (nonstrictly decreasing) Lya- punov function for the overall hybrid system from weak ISS- Lyapunov functions for the subsystems in the interconnection. Asymptotic stability of the hybrid system is then concluded by applying results of LaSalle type. The utility of this approach is illustrated on feedback systems arising in event-triggered control and quantized control.},
  Annote                   = {This paper presents a methodology for the analysis of stability of hybrid systems, in the sense developped by Teel, Goebel and Sanfelice. 

The main idea consists of decompose the original system into two interconnected subsystems that have the same jump and flow sets as the original system. 

The main result of this paper is Proposition 1, here it is shown that a storage function decreases along solution with a particular behavior: the solutions neither have two jumps in a row nor two flows in a row. 

In the following, the authors show that the result from Proposition 1 is sufficient to some systems as illustred by Section IV.A. "Emulation with event-triggered sampling", where solutions behave as in the hypothesis of that Proposition.},

Starting with the Lyapunov's criteria for stability, the author shows generalization of sufficient conditions stability and unstability of equilibrium points.

In Section 3 (On asymptotic stability), the authors present what were the stability concepts :

- In the sense of Lyapunov
- Uniform stability
- Asymptotic stability in the sense of Lyapunov
- Equiasymptotic stability
- Uniform-asymptotic stability
- Exponential-asymptotic stability

The author proves what are the relationship between these concepts and what the flow map $f$ must satisfy in order to have some relationship. 

Also, the authors compiles a list of sufficient conditions for the different concepts of stability by means of the existence of a Lyapunov function. An interesting illustration concerning these theorems is given in Figure 5.

In Section 5, the author presents the theorem to allows one to conclude about stability of the origin by analysing the homogeneity of a function at the origin.},

  Abstract                 = {We apply recent results on robust global asymptotic stabilization of the attitude of a single rigid body to the problem of globally synchronizing the attitude of a network of rigid bodies using a decentralized strategy. The proposed hybrid feedback scheme relies on the communication of a binary logic variable between each pair of neighboring rigid bodies that determines the orientation of a torque component acting to reduce their relative error. Through a hysteretic switch of this logic variable, the hybrid feedback achieves global synchronization under the assumption that the network is connected and acyclic. The hysteresis eliminates chattering while preventing the #x201C;unwinding phenomenon #x201D; apparent in some quaternion-based attitude control schemes. The results are exercised in a numerical example.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that controlling the attitude of a rigid body is subject to topological constraints. We illustrate, with examples, the problems that arise when using continuous and (memoryless) discontinuous quaternion-based state-feedback control laws for global attitude stabilization. We propose a quaternion-based hybrid feedback scheme that solves the global attitude tracking problem in three scenarios: full state measurements, only measurements of attitude, and measurements of attitude with angular velocity measurements corrupted by a constant bias. In each case, the hybrid feedback is dynamic and incorporates hysteresis-based switching using a single binary logic variable for each quaternion error state. When only attitude measurements are available or the angular rate is corrupted by a constant bias, the proposed controller is observer-based and incorporates an additional quaternion filter and bias observer. The hysteresis mechanism enables the proposed scheme to simultaneously avoid the #x201C;unwinding phenomenon #x201D; and sensitivity to arbitrarily small measurement noise that is present in discontinuous feedbacks. These properties are shown using a general framework for hybrid systems, and the results are demonstrated by simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Systems x{\"E}{\texttrademark}(t)=F(t,x(t),{\^I}Âµ) depending on a small parameter {\^I}Âµ are considered. We introduce a concept of convergence of such a system to a system x{\"E}{\texttrademark}(t)=G(x(t)). Assuming this convergence, we prove that global asymptotic stability for x{\"E}{\texttrademark}(t)=G(x(t)) implies some notion of ``practical stability'' for x{\"E}{\texttrademark}(t)=F(t,x(t),{\^I}Âµ) if F({\^A}Â·,x,{\^I}Âµ) satisfies a periodicity assumption. We apply this theory to a ``practical stability'' analysis of ``fast time-varying'' systems studied in periodic averaging, and of ``highly oscillatory'' systems studied by Sussmann and Liu (1991). We use this theory for the ``practical stabilization'' of a class of driftless control-affine systems},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a calculus for computing Filippov's differential inclusion which simplifies the analysis of dynamical systems described by differential equations with a discontinuous right-hand side. In particular, when a slightly generalized Lyapunov theory is used, the rigorous stability analysis of variable structure systems is routine. As an example, a variable structure control law for rigid-link robot manipulators is described and its stability is proved.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we show, for any nonlinear system that is asymptotically controllable to a compact set, that a logic-based, hybrid feedback can achieve asymptotic stabilization that is robust to small measurement noise, actuator error, and external disturbance. The construction of such a feedback hinges upon recasting a stabilizing patchy feedback in a hybrid framework by making it dynamic with a discrete state, while insisting on semicontinuity and closedness properties of the hybrid feedback and of the resulting closed-loop hybrid system. The robustness of stability is then shown as a generic property of hybrid systems having the said regularity properties. Auxiliary results give uniformity of convergence and of overshoots for hybrid systems, and give a characterization of asymptotic stability of compact sets.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Let $\dot{x}=f(x,u)$ be a general control system; the existence of asmooth control-Lyapunov function does not imply the existence of a continuousstabilizing feedback. However, we show that it allows us to design astabilizing feedback in the Krasovskii (or Filippov) sense. Moreover,we recall a definition of a control-Lyapunov functionin the case of a nonsmooth function; it is based on Clarke'sgeneralized gradient. Finally, with an inedite proof we prove that the existence of this type of control-Lyapunov function is equivalent to the existence of aclassical control-Lyapunov function. This property leads to a generalizationof a result on the systems with integrator. },

  Abstract                 = {For a class of hybrid systems given in terms of constrained differential and difference equations/inclusions, we define control Lyapunov functions, and study their existence when compact sets are asymptotically stable as well as the stabilizability properties guaranteed when they exist. Recent converse Lyapunov theorems for the class of hybrid systems under study enable us to assert that asymptotic stabilizability of a compact set implies the existence of a smooth control Lyapunov function. When control Lyapunov functions are available, conditions for the existence of continuous state-feedback control laws, both providing practical and global stabilizability properties, are provided.},
  Annote                   = {This paper provides a result linking between stabilizability and the existence of control Lyapunov functions. Then this result is related to the existence of continuous stabilizing feedbacks.

As stated in the paper 

"Control Lyapunov functions provide a link between sta- bilizability and asymptotic controllability to the origin for nonlinear systems, [{\ldots}] "

The results on the paper are devided into two:

1) Assymptotic stabilizability of a compact set implies the existence of a control Lyapunov function with respect to the said compact set.

2) Existence of stabilizing state-feedback laws for hybrid systems when a control Lyapunov function is available.

" The reason of insisting on continuous feedback laws is that, when using such feedbacks to control hybrid systems with regular data, results on robustness of stability in [19] can be applied to the closed-loop system."},

The required nested condition is a combination of the conditions in nested Matrosov theorems for time-varying continuous-time and discrete-time systems available in the literature. Our result also shows that Matrosov's theorem is a reasonable alternative to LaSalle's invariance principle for time-invariant hybrid systems to conclude attractivity to a compact set. We illustrate the application of our main result by examples.},

These two aspects are complementary, since the latter approaches are, typically, based upon the inductive verification of the validity of the former system properties under compositions (in the terminology used in [62], the ``activation'' of theoretical concepts leads to ``constructive'' control). This expository presentation addresses the first of these aspects, and in particular the precise formulation of questions of robustness with respect to disturbances, formulated in the paradigm of input to state stability . We provide an intuitive and informal presentation of the main concepts. More precise statements, especially about older results, are given in the cited papers, as well as in several previous surveys such as [103, 105] (of which the present paper represents an update), but we provide a little more detail about relatively recent work. Regarding applications and extensions of the basic framework, we give some pointers to the literature, but we do not focus on feedback design and specific engineering problems; for the latter we refer the reader to textbooks such as [27, 43, 44, 58, 60, 66, 96].},

Both variants are equivalent to ISS for linear systems. For general nonlinear systems, it is shown that one of the new properties is strictly weaker than ISS, while the other one is equivalent to it. For bilinear systems, a complete characterization is provided of the weaker property. An interesting fact about functions of type KL is proved as well.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider nonlinear control systems for which there exist some structural obstacles to the design of classical continuous stabilizing feedback laws. More precisely, it is studied systems for which the backstepping tool for the design of stabilizers can not be applied. On the contrary, it leads to feedback laws such that the origin of the closed-loop system is not globally asymptotically stable, but a suitable attractor (strictly containing the origin) is practically asymptotically stable. Then, a design method is suggested to build a hybrid feedback law combining a backstepping controller with a locally stabilizing controller. The results are illustrated for a nonlinear system which, due to the structure of the system, does not have a priori any globally stabilizing backstepping controller.},

The main contribution concerns the sample and hold policy that depends on the state of the systems. Roughly, the idea is to set the sample and hold in order that the discrete-time model inherits properties from the continuous-time as asymptotic controlability. The author also links the length of the sample and hold interval to degree of homogeneity of the system.

Then, the discrete-time feedback law is designed by solving an infite horizon optimization problem.},

- The definition of generalized dilation of hybrid systems, called gilation
- Results concerning stability: 1) Under homogeneity, local and global robustly stability are equivalent. Namely, if a hybrid system is homogenenous with respect to a gilation, then it is robustly stable. The proof of this result is done by proving the existence a Lyapunov function using the proof of

The results are based on the assumption that a system has unique solutions. The main are

Theorem 9: If there exists anontrivial solution to a system, then there exists a gilation with respect to which the system is homogeneous.

It turns out that uniqueness of solutions (in both directions of time) is indeed a sufficient condition for a system to be homogeneous with respect to some generalized dilation. The relation between homogeneity and monotonicity is also studied and it is shown that if a system is monotone with respect to some V (a positive function) then there exists a generalized dilation with respect to which both the system and V are homogeneous. Another result presented in the paper is the equivalence of local monotonicity and global monotonicity under homogeneity},

  Abstract                 = {The first part of this two-part paper presents a general theory of dissipative dynamical systems. The mathematical model used is a state space model and dissipativeness is defined in terms of an inequality involving the storage function and the supply function. It is shown that the storage function satisfies an a priori inequality: it is bounded from below by the available storage and from above by the required supply. The available storage is the amount of internal storage which may be recovered from the system and the required supply is the amount of supply which has to be delivered to the system in order to transfer it from the state of minimum storage to a given state. These functions are themselves possible storage functions, i.e. , they satisfy the dissipation inequality. Moreover, since the class of possible storage functions forms a convex set, there is thus a continuum of possible storage functions ranging from its lower bound, the available storage, to its upper bound, the required supply. The paper then considers interconnected systems. It is shown that dissipative systems which are interconnected via a neutral interconnection constraint define a new dissipative dynamical system and that the sum of the storage functions of the individual subsystems is a storage function for the interconnected system. The stability of dissipative systems is then investigated and it is shown that a point in the state space where the storage function attains a local minimum defines a stable equilibrium and that the storage function is a Lyapunov function for this equilibrium. These results are then applied to several examples. These concepts and results will be applied to linear dynamical systems with quadratic supply rates in the second part of this paper.},

A necessary and sufficient frequency domain condition for dissipativeness is derived. This is followed by the evaluation of the available storage and the required supply and of a time-domain criterion for dissipativeness involving certain matrix inequalities. The quadratic storage functions and the dissipation functions are then examined. The discussion then turns to reciprocal systems and it is shown that external reciprocity and dissipativeness imply the existence of a state space realization which is also internally reciprocal and dissipative. The paper proceeds with an examination of reversible systems and of relaxation systems. In particular, it is shown how a unique internal storage function may be defined for relaxation systems. These results are applied to the synthesis of electrical networks and the theory of linear viscoelastic materials.},

Since such a framework has not been analyzed before, existing concepts have to be modified.

After deriving that our solution is time consistent, our numerical analysis first shows that a technological breakthrough generates equilibrium investment behavior that admits anticipation waves, which are enhanced by competition. Second, the shape of these anticipation waves depends on the age of the underlying capital good: for younger capital goods the upward peaks are more pronounced, whereas for older ones this holds for the downward peaks. Third, we show that if a firm is able to anticipate on future technological developments, this results in a higher market share in the long run.},

  Abstract                 = { The object of this paper is to outline a stability theory for input-output problems using functional methods. More particularly, the aim is to derive open loop conditions for the boundedness and continuity of feedback systems, without, at the beginning, placing restrictions on linearity or time invariance. It will be recalled that, in the special case of a linear time invariant feedback system, stability can be assessed using Nyquist's criterion; roughly speaking, stability depends on the mounts by which signals are amplified and delayed in flowing around the loop. An attempt is made here to show that similar considerations govern the behavior of feedback systems in general-that stability of nonlinear time-varying feedback systems can often be assessed from certain gross features of input-output behavior, which are related to amplification and delay. This paper is divided into two parts: Part I contains general theorems, free of restrictions on linearity or time invariance; Part II, which will appear in a later issue, contains applications to a loop with one nonlinear element. There are three main results in Part I, which follow the introduction of concepts of gain, conicity, positivity, and strong positivity: THEOREM 1: If the open loop gain is less than one, then the closed loop is bounded. THEOREM 2: If the open loop can be factored into two, suitably proportioned, conic relations, then the closed loop is bounded. THEOREM 3: If the open loop can be factored into two positive relations, one of which is strongly positive and has finite gain, then the closed loop is bounded. Results analogous to Theorems I-3, but with boundedness replaced by continuity, are also obtained.},
  Annote                   = {This paper introduces the notion of input-output gains by modelling feedback as mappings from a space of input functions to the space of output function.

This way, the author uses notions from variational calculus (such as L-spaces) to the study of stability of systems. This approach is justified by author in the following passage:

" by posing the feedback problem in terms of relations (rather than in terms of operators) all questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions are avoided ".

The concept the gain is then defined as a supremum and an application is the study of the stabilization of interonnected system by using gains composition approach. In order words, the system is stable in closed-loop if in open loop the gains composition is sufficiently small.

This study is based on the Contraction Principle.},

  Abstract                 = { The object of this paper is to outline a stability theory based on functional methods. Part I of the paper was devoted to a general feedback configuration. Part II is devoted to a feedback system consisting of two elements, one of which is linear time-invariant, and the other nonlinear. An attempt is made to unify several stability conditions, including Popov's condition, into a single principle. This principle is based on the concepts of conicity and positivity, and provides a link with the notions of gain and phase shift of the linear theory. Part II draws on the (generalized) notion of a "sector non-linearity." A nonlinearityNis said to be INSIDE THE SECTOR{alpha,beta}if it satisfies an inequality of the typelangle(Nx-alphax)_{t}, (Nx-betax)_{t}rangleleq0. IfNis memoryless and is characterized by a graph in the plane, then this simply means that the graph lies inside a sector of the plane. However, the preceding definition extends the concept to include nonlinearities with memory. There are two main results. The first result, the CIRCLE THEOREM, asserts in part that: If the nonlinearity is inside a sector{alpha, beta}, and if the frequency response of the linear element avoids a "critical region" in the complex plane, then the closed loop is bounded; ifalpha gt; 0then the critical region is a disk whose center is halfway between the points-1/alphaand-1/beta, and whose diameter is greater than the distance between these points. The second result is a method for taking into account the detailed properties of the nonlinearity to get improved stability conditions. This method involves the removal of a "multiplier" from the linear element. The frequency response of the linear element is modified by the removal, and, in effect, the size of the critical region is reduced. Several conditions, including Popov's condition, are derived by this method, under various restrictions on the nonlinearityN; the following cases are treated: (i)Nis instantaneously inside a sector{alpha, beta}. (ii)Nsatisfies (i) and is memoryless and time-invariant. (iii)Nsatisfies (ii) and has a restricted - slope.},
